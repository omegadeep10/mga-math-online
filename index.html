			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Middle Georgia University's online math classes are delivered via Brightspace(D2L), but there are 3 required proctored exam experiences. All the content for the class is available through Brightspace and students are expected to follow the recommended schedule and complete their work on time. All classes still require students to purchase and use relevant textbooks; some classes also require you to buy and use access to an online MathLab. See the <a href="#classes">classes</a> section for more information.</p>
			
			<h3 id="difficulty">Online Math Classes Are Rigorous</h3>
			<p>Taking a math course online is in no way easier than taking a math course in person. You will be required to learn the same information and complete the same exams you would have to do in a face-to-face class. An online class is simply more convenient for some students since travel to campus is not required daily or weekly.</p>
			<p>An online course will requires the following from you:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Competence in the content of prerequisite course material.</li>
				<li>Weekly, if not daily, time commitment.</li>
				<li>Self-direction, organization, persistence, and maturity.</li>
				<li>Ability to meet deadlines on your own.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Proctored Exams</h1>
			<p>For students living in the Middle Georgia State's geographic area, there will be scheduled proctored exam sessions on each of the following Middle Georgia campuses: Cochran, Macon and Warner Robins. These proctoring sessions have no additional fee and will be proctored by one of the online mathematics faculty members during the time listed on the schedule of classes and the dates listed below and on your syllabus. The proctoring room assignments and times will be listed in your syllabus.</p>
			<p>Note that only students who cannot attend any of the above three campuses may use another approved proctoring center. There will most likely be a fee associated with such proctoring, and the student must set up their own appointment, preferable on the same day as the campus proctoring sessions.</p> 
			<p>For either case, there are NO makeup exams nor exceptions for any student, but students may attend either session as listed below or use an approved proctoring center. Students are required to show photo ID in order to take each exam. Photo ID is required at all proctored exam sessions. </p>
			
			<h3 id="schedules">Proctored Exam Schedules</h3>
			<p>There are three MGA locations for each of the following proctored exams (no appointment necessary and no fee). These sites are proctored by online instructors.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exam Locations</li>
				<li><span class="label">Macon Campus</span> Mathematics Auditorium</li>
				<li><span class="label">WRC Campus</span> Auditorium</li>
				<li><span class="label">Cochran Campus</span> Dillard Hall Auditorium</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Exam Dates</li>
				<li><span class="label">Exam 1</span> Tuesday, September 15, 2015 at 6:55 PM</li>
				<li><span class="label">Exam 2</span> Tuesday, November 3, 2015 at 6:55 PM</li>
				<li><span class="label">Exam 3</span> Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 6:00 PM</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Please note these exam times and location are subject to change at any time. Please check your syallabus for information on the location and time for your class specifically.</p>
			
			<h3 id="off-campus">Off Campus Proctored Exam Schedules</h3>
			<p>If a non-MGA proctoring center is chosen of the list of approved testing sites listed in the Testing Center Widget on the main page of your online mathematics class in D2L, then you must select that site and use the information seen with a hover over the site name to make your own appointment, preferable on the same day listed above. You will not have access to D2L until the first day of classes. If no site is near your location, you will have to find a site that accepts exams by e-mail and scan and return by em ail and get the site approved before the end of the first week of classes.</p>

		<div id="requirements">
			<h1>Course Requirements</h1>
			<p>Online mathematics courses are NOT self-paced. The schedule for the classes is laid out for you in the Calendar tool. Students must log in daily or nearly daily, spending at least 9 hours per week in a Fall or Spring semester and 18 hours per week in a short Summer semester working on the various aspect of the course including reading, view lecture or example videos, working homework problems, quizzes and online exams. This times listed are the same time a face-to-face student is expected to be in class or working on class assignments.</p>
			<p>Students are responsible for having a working computer that connects to the Internet for daily use throughout the semester. Local students may use on campus computers available on any of our campuses should their home computer fail for any reason. Non-local students are responsible for finding a back-up computer as necessary for completely their work in a timely manner.</p>
			<p> Students may get help from their instructor or their classmates at any time by posting questions in the Discussion area of D2L.</p>
